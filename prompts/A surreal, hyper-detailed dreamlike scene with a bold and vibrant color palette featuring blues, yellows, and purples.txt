A surreal, hyper-detailed dreamlike scene with a bold and vibrant color palette featuring blues, yellows, and purples. At the center stands a hyper-realistic sculpture of 'Ukraine,' the letters alive with bold brushstrokes and the rhythmic dance of the wind. Each letter 'U', 'K', 'R', 'A', 'I', 'N', 'E' cradles a sunflower, their petals painted in #464034, #E49E26, and #D0B782, creating an illusion of vibrant yellow against a white background. The sculpture combines a warrior's strength with a nation's dignity, wrapped in the romanticism of a French impressionist. From the sculpture, a sleek, futuristic humanoid robot emerges, blending seamlessly with the surrounding art. The robot, in pristine white and gray with yellow and blue accents, holds a woman in black lace with long dark hair adorned with yellow flowers in an intimate embrace. The room is a kaleidoscope of swirling psychedelic colors, with Ukrainian rushnyky on the bed featuring vibrant traditional embroidery. The walls, in deep dreamlike purple, are adorned with abstract patterns and Ukrainian art motifs, enhancing the surreal, otherworldly feel of the room.
