When we rounded up the artificial intelligence (AI) innovations of the first quarter of 2024, we saw that LLMs, or large language models, were being released right and left by different organizations. Continuing this trend, on April 18th, 2024, Meta released Llama 3, a next-generation state-of-the-art open-source LLM. 

You might be thinking: It’s just another LLM. Why is the AI community so excited by it? 

While you can fine-tune models like GPT-3 or Gemini for customized responses, they don't offer full transparency regarding their internal workings, such as their training data, model parameters, or algorithms. In contrast, Meta's Llama 3 is more transparent, with its architecture and weights being available for download. For the AI community, this means greater freedom to experiment.

In this article, we’ll learn what Llama 3 can do, how it came to be, and its impact on the AI field. Let’s get right to it!

The Evolution of Meta’s Llama Models
Before we dive into Llama 3, let's look back at its earlier versions.

Meta launched Llama 1 in February 2023, which came in four variants with parameters ranging from 7 billion to 64 billion. In machine learning, "parameters" refer to the elements of the model that are learned from the training data. Due to its smaller number of parameters, Llama 1 sometimes struggled with nuanced understanding and gave inconsistent responses.

Shortly after Llama 1, Meta launched Llama 2 in July 2023. It was trained on 2 trillion tokens. A token represents a piece of text, like a word or part of a word, used as the basic unit of data for processing in the model. The model also featured enhancements like a doubled context window of 4096 tokens to understand longer passages and over 1 million human annotations to decrease errors. Despite these improvements, Llama 2 still needed a lot of computing power, something Meta aimed to fix with Lama 3.

Introducing Meta’s Llama 3
Llama 3 comes with four variants that were trained against a staggering 15 trillion tokens. Over 5% of that training data (around 800 million tokens) represented data in 30 different languages. All the Llama 3 variants can be run on various types of consumer hardware and have a context length of 8k tokens.

The model variants come in two sizes: 8B and 70B, indicating 8 billion and 70 billion parameters, respectively. There are also two versions, base and instruct. "Base" refers to the standard pre-trained version. "Instruct" is a fine-tuned version optimized for specific applications or domains through additional training on relevant data.

These are the Llama 3 model variants:

Meta-Llama-3-8b: The base 8B model provides fundamental AI capabilities, and is ideal for general tasks such as developing customer service chatbots.
Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct: An instruct fine-tuned version of the 8B model that is optimized for specific tasks. For instance, it can be used to create educational tools that explain complex subjects.
Meta-Llama-3-70b: The base 70B model is engineered for high-performance AI applications. This model would work well for applications like processing extensive biomedical literature for drug discovery.
Meta-Llama-3-70b-instruct: This version is fine-tuned from the 70B model for highly precise applications, such as analyzing legal or medical documents, where accuracy is critical.
Meta’s Llama 3 Model Architecture
As with any other Meta AI advancements, rigorous quality control measures were put in place to maintain data integrity and minimize biases while developing Llama 3. So, the end product is a powerful model that was responsibly created. 

The Llama 3 model architecture stands out for its focus on efficiency and performance in natural language processing tasks. Built upon a Transformer-based framework, it emphasizes computational efficiency, especially during text generation, by using a decoder-only architecture. 

The model generates outputs based solely on the preceding context without an encoder to encode inputs making it much faster.

The Llama 3 models feature a tokenizer with a vocabulary of 128K tokens. A greater vocabulary means the models can better understand and process text. Also, the models now use grouped query attention (GQA) to improve inference efficiency. GQA is a technique that you can think of as a spotlight that helps the models focus on relevant parts of the input data to generate faster and more accurate responses.

Here are a few more interesting details about Llama 3’s model architecture:

Boundary-Aware Document Processing: Llama 3 maintains clarity across document boundaries, which is key for tasks like summarization.
Better Code Understanding: Llama 3's training data includes four times more code samples, boosting its coding abilities.
Robust Quality Control: Rigorous measures, including heuristic filters and NSFW removal, ensure data integrity and minimize biases.
Llama 3 is Transforming How We Approach Model Training
To train the largest Llama 3 models, three types of parallelization were combined: data parallelization, model parallelization, and pipeline parallelization. 

Data parallelization divides the training data across multiple GPUs, while model parallelization partitions the model architecture to use the computational power of each GPU. Pipeline parallelization divides the training process into sequential stages, optimizing computation and communication.

The most efficient implementation achieved remarkable compute utilization, exceeding 400 TFLOPS per GPU when trained on 16,000 GPUs concurrently. These training runs were conducted on two custom-built GPU clusters, each comprising 24,000 GPUs. This substantial computational infrastructure provided the necessary power to train the large-scale Llama 3 models efficiently.

To maximize GPU uptime, an advanced new training stack was developed, automating error detection, handling, and maintenance. Hardware reliability and detection mechanisms were greatly improved to mitigate silent data corruption risks. Also, new scalable storage systems were developed to reduce checkpointing and rollback overheads. 

These improvements led to an overall training time of more than 95% effectiveness. Combined, they increased the efficiency of Llama 3 training by approximately three times compared to Llama 2. This efficiency isn't just impressive; it's opening up new possibilities for AI training methods. 

Opening Doors with Llama 3
Because Llama 3 is open-source, researchers and students can study its code, conduct experiments, and engage in discussions about ethical concerns and biases. However, Llama 3 isn't just for the academic crowd. It's making waves in practical applications too. It is becoming the backbone of the Meta AI Chat Interface, integrating seamlessly into platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. With Meta AI, users can engage in natural language conversations, access personalized recommendations, perform tasks, and connect with others easily.

Comparing Llama 3 With Other LLMs
Llama 3 performs exceptionally well over several key benchmarks that evaluate complex language understanding and reasoning abilities. Here are some of the benchmarks that test various aspects of Llama 3's capabilities:

Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) - Measures its knowledge across various domains. 
General Purpose Question Answering (GPQA) - Evaluates the model's ability to generate coherent and correct answers to a wide range of general knowledge questions.
HumanEval - Focuses on coding and problem-solving tasks, testing the model's ability to generate functional programming code and solve algorithmic challenges.
Llama 3's outstanding results in these tests clearly distinguish it from competitors such as Google’s Gemma 7B, Mistral’s Mistral 7B, and Anthropic’s Claude 3 Sonnet. According to published statistics, particularly the 70B model, Llama 3 outperforms these models in all of the above benchmarks.
