In a haunting, evocative scene, the boundaries of reality and imagination blur, the sight unfolding before us as poignant as it is striking. The image is a oneiric mixed-media representation, with a triangular composition acting as its structural backbone. On the bottom of this triangle, a field of vibrant sunflowers ripe with life, their golden hues radiating against the stark blues that fill the canvas. The rest fills the upper parts of this triangular space, a collision of life and destruction, dreams and reality, hope and despair.
Dominating the twilight drama is a colossal, sleeping child's face, whose peaceful serenity speaks to an unconquered innocence amidst the rubble. This child is positioned on the left of the triangle, lying against the shattered remains of what once was a children's hospital - a beacon of joy and laughter that had become a monument to sorrow and tears.
Looming across from this scene, at the apex of this tertiary sculpture, stands a relentless female figure, clutching her pistols in tight fists. Her fierce eyes bore into the unseen danger, even as the faded shadows behind her reveal the silhouette of what appears to be a father, hinting to the protective instinct that drives her. Her long dark hair whips in the unseen wind, each strand painting a stroke of despair, determination, and defiance against the backdrop that surrounds her.
Behind this scene, through the shattered remains of the hospital, the minimalist Tryzub sculpture emerges. This abstract embodiment of Ukrainian resilience, the three intersecting tridents echoing the ancient heraldry of Ukraine. The sculpture seamlessly dints with the retreating silhouette of a father, a nod to the legacy handed down by ancestors and lost loved ones. Embedded in the center of the Tryzub, blossom three sunflower silhouettes, their seed-heavy heads catching the dying light, their colorless petals bowing to the memory of the innocent.
