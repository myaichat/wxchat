The image depicts a poignant scene rendered in an illustrative style. There's a giant, sleeping ukrainian baby girl face among the rubble of destroyed children hospital, suggesting a peaceful innocence amidst chaos and destruction. Burning candle is in foreground. "R.I.P." . Other patients of children's hospital - kids and their parents , portrayed as small figures in comparison to the massive face, are seen actively searching through the ruins. There's a sense of contrast between the child's serene expression and the surrounding destruction. The artwork carries a date and a location, "KYIV" "OHMATDIT'' "08.07.24," which references the city of Kyiv in Ukraine, and appears to be signed by the artist. The scene seems to comment on the tragic impact of conflict on the most vulnerable and the enduring spirit of those who respond to such crises.
