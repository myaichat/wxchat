In the heart of a dark, moonless night sky that drapes an apocalyptic landscape in a shroud of obsidian, one striking image stands out against the backdrop of desolation. At the forefront of this haunting scene, a colossal candle--majestic and vibrant in its golden warmth--illuminates the composition with an almost magical glow, serving as the pivotal source of light. The candle's flame dances against the dark expanse, casting lengthening shadows that speak of secrets and somber tales. In the midst of this eternal night, the face of a Ukrainian baby girl, now surrounded by innumerable tiny stars and galaxies, glimmers from the shadows. Her visage, a soothing oasis in a sea of destruction, is framed by the vibrant shades of cream and baby pink, which contrast starkly against the canvas of black. Her closed eyes, serene and at peace, remain oblivious to the destruction that surrounds her. From herutan shoulders, feeble yet enchanting angel wings comprised of vanishing wisps of light and shadow extend, arching over her like protective guardians. These wings are barely perceptible, below the threshold of comprehension, adding to the mythical undercurrent of the image as they seem to be tethered between realms. Positioned near the infant visage, a grave inscription of "R.I.P." floats within the candlelight, tied closely with the soft, golden hues, imparting a tale of sorrow and remembrance. Beside it, the "08.07.24" and "KYIV" "OHMATDIT" scripts appear in the same manner--a cryptic yet poignant tribute etched in time. The composition finds harmony in this radial blend. The starlit sky, the radiant candle, the solemn inscription, the baby girl's transcendent face, and the whisper-like angel wings follow in a spiral of elements centered around the child's serenity. Shadows eke out from the unseen remnants of the world, augmented by the candle's ray, completing the visual tapestry with its dark hue contrasted by her radiant nature
