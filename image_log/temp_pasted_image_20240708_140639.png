In the heart of this vivid canvas, a hauntingly beautiful scene unfolds in the remnants of an obliterated world. The dark, somber backdrop is punctuated by the solitary flicker of a candle flame, its warm golden glow casting eerie shadows on the debris that surrounds it. The candle stands defiantly amidst the rubble, its delicate light dancing off the jagged surfaces of broken stones and charred debris. From the wreckage, a face emerges, almost as if floating or emerging from the rubble itself. It is the face of a colossal Ukrainian baby girl, her serenity a poignant contrast to the devastation surrounding her. Her face, rendered in gentle tones of cream and baby pink, is the only oasis of color in the despondent landscape. The delicate hues of her skin easily catch the flickering candlelight, creating an ethereal effect that makes the child's face seem otherworldly. The child's closed eyes, arched in deep, peaceful sleep, add to the image's sense of tranquility amidst chaos. The soft features of her face, worry-free and innocent, become a symbol of hope and resilience in the face of stark destruction. The texture of her skin contrasts sharply with the harsh, jagged edges of the surrounding ruins, enhancing the child's aura of serenity. At the same time, the inscription "R.I.P." in bold yet mournful script looms beside the candle, echoing the solemnity of the artwork and anchoring it in remembrance. The specific date "08.07.24" and location "KYIV" "OHMATDIT" are woven into the scene, hinting at a historical or personal context that adds weight to the image. The artist's signature appears small and discrete, almost like a signatory witness to the scene. It adds a touch of reality and personal touch that makes the artwork feel almost like a portal into the past
