In the center of this evocative image, a colossal Ukrainian baby girl's face emerges from the ruins of an obliterated world. Her serene expression, rendered in soft tones of cream and baby pink, contrasts sharply with the harsh, jagged edges of the charred debris that surrounds her. A solitary candle flickers defiantly amidst the rubble, its warm, golden glow casting eerie shadows and illuminating the child's face with an ethereal light. The delicate hues of her skin catch the candlelight, creating a soothing effect that makes her seem otherworldly. The baby girl's closed eyes, arched in deep, peaceful sleep, add to the image's sense of tranquility amidst chaos. Small, delicate angel wings sprout from her back, emphasizing her divine and innocent nature. The wings are barely visible, as if they are made of light and shadow, adding to the dreamlike quality of the scene. The "R.I.P." inscription, written in bold yet mournful script, looms beside the candle, echoing the solemnity of the artwork and anchoring it in remembrance. The specific date "08.07.24" and location "KYIV" "OHMATDIT" are woven into the scene, hinting at a historical or personal context that adds weight to the image. The artist's signature appears small and discrete, almost like a signatory witness to the scene. The background is dark and somber, with hints of green and blue, reminiscent of a night sky. The warm, golden glow of the candle is the primary light source, creating a sense of intimacy and focus on the baby girl's face. The overall composition is balanced, with the baby girl's face and the candle occupying the center, and the ruins and the inscription framing them. The image is a powerful testament to hope, resilience, and the enduring power of innocence in the face of destruction
