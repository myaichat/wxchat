Envision a surreal yet harmonious fusion of two contrasting worlds brought together through the power of imagination. At the heart of this fantastical realm lies a minimalist 3D sculpture named "Ukraine." This masterpiece encapsulates the quintessential Ukrainian identity by integrating the national symbol of the Ukrainian Tryzub. Alongside this powerful emblem, the sculpture presents three sunflowers captured in motion, seemingly danced by the gentle caress of the breeze.
